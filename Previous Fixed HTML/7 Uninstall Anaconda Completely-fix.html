<h1>Uninstalling Anaconda (Completely)</h1>
<p>When facing stubborn environment problems, sometimes the best course of action is to completely uninstall the
	environment AND Anaconda and to start over.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pre-Uninstallation Verification Step:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>If you share your computer with another User who also uses Python:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Pause here and check with them BEFORE you uninstall anaconda.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>You will be removing
					all of their python environments too,</strong> even though they have a separate User account.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>If you share your computer with someone and they have concerns about uninstalling
			anaconda:&nbsp;</strong>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Stop here (for now)</strong>.<ul>
					<li>Do not move forward with the instructions until you have spoken with your
						instructor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h4>Official&nbsp;Steps for Fully Uninstalling Anaconda:</h4>
<p>The following steps are taken directly from the <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/uninstall/"
		target="_blank">Official&nbsp;Uninstalling Anaconda documentation page</a>, specifically "Option B. Full
	uninstall using Anaconda-Clean and simple remove."</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Install the Anaconda-Clean package from Anaconda Prompt (terminal on Linux or macOS):</strong></li>
</ul>
<pre data-language="ruby" class="rainbow active_pre">conda install anaconda-clean</pre>
<ul>
	<li>In the same window, run the following command:</li>
</ul>
<pre data-language="ruby" class="rainbow">anaconda-clean --yes</pre>
<ul>
	<li>Once the process has been completed, manually delete any "anaconda3" or "anaconda2" folders that still
		exist.&nbsp;<ul>
			<li>It may be located in one of several&nbsp;possible folders. Run the following "ls -a" commands until you
				see a folder called "anconda2" or "anaconda3".&nbsp;</li>
			<li><strong>Once you see an anaconda folder, take note of:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>&nbsp;Which command showed the folder.</strong>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>&nbsp;Specifically, what did the command say after "ls -a"&nbsp;</strong></li>
							<li>We will refer to this as your "base folder" in the final step.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><strong>If the anaconda folder was "anconda2" or "anaconda3"</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>We will refer to this as your "anaconda folder" in the final step.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>and j</strong>ump to the very last command at the bottom of the page, with those 2 pieces of
				information.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<pre data-language="ruby" class="rainbow">ls -a ~/
			ls -a ~/opt/
			ls -a /opt/</pre>
<ul>
	<li>Run the final command to remove the anaconda folder once you've identified your "base folder" and "anaconda
		folder".<ul>
			<li>Replace {base_folder} with the actual folder name</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>Replace {anaconda_folder} with the actual folder name.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<pre data-language="ruby" class="rainbow">rm -rf {base_folder}{anaconda_folder}
			</pre>
<p><br></p>
<p>Once you've replaced the placeholder folder names with your actual folder names, the command should look something
	like this:</p>
<pre data-language="ruby" class="rainbow">rm -rf ~/opt/anaconda3
			# or 
			rm -rf ~/anaconda2
			# or 
			rm -rf ~/opt/anaconda3</pre>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Final Verification&nbsp;Step:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Now, open a <strong>new</strong> terminal window and try running the "conda" command again. Your terminal should
		say that conda is not found.<ul>
			<li>If it says conda is not found, you are now ready to jump back up to the "Step 3 Commands" header above.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>If your computer still displays a list of conda commands, see the final portion of the <a
					href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/uninstall/#removing-anaconda-path-from-bash-profile"
					target="_blank">Official Uninstallation Instructions "Removing Anaconda from
					.bash_profile"</a>&nbsp; <strong>You may want to contact your instructor if you do not understand
					the final instructions in the official instructions.</strong></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
