## Installation Overview


**These steps should take ~30-90 minutes**, depending on the speed of your machine and internet connection.

- By the end of the instructions, you will:
	- Install GitHub Desktop,</li>
	- Install Anaconda
	- Create a special Python environment (dojo-env)
	- Supercharge Jupyter Notebooks with Extensions
	- Install Visual Studio Code.


For several steps, there are multiple versions of the instructions, depending on what operating system you are using (i.e. a Windows computer, vs a Mac with an Intel processor, vs a Mac with an Apple Chip (m1/m1pro/m2/etc).


- For steps, 1-3, please make sure you are following the correct instructons for your OS

## BRIEF SUMMARY

1. **A Linux-based bash shell/terminal:**
   - Linux users and MacOS users have this built-in to their OS.
       - On MacOS, the shell is called Terminal and can be found in `Applications>Utilities` in Finder
       - OR you can use spotlight search and search for "Terminal".
   
   
   -  **Windows users should install GitBash, instead of using the windows command prompt**
      - Download  the Git for Windows Installer: [Git for Windows download](https://gitforwindows.org/)
      
    - Use the default options, EXCEPT when you see the "Advanced Installation Options" window, check BOTH options, like in the screenshot below:
